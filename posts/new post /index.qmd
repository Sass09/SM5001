Experiment notes:

-   Scaling is confusing

-   Pictures which depicted nature were less able to be forgotten

-   I found that the more I was trying to forget the pictures, the more they would flash before my eyes

-   It seems unnatural when instructed to forget

-   When I tried to count numbers, it kind of helped to forget, most likely because the pictures did not have any context and such distraction helped me

-   I did not just count numbers, but also visualized them

-   When asked to remember, I did not put any extra effort

-   Interesting note: pictures which had less things in them, like sea or a grey empty hall were harder to forget

-   I would remember the second picture more than first if asked to forget

-   What does replay mean here? Because sometimes if food was shown, i would have the faintest picture

-   Looking elsewhere also helped me forget

-   It is easier to remember the second one in remember condition too

-

Our self is modeled after our intricately woven web of instances that occurred in our lives known as memory. Decades of research has been behind explaining as to how this cognitive process works and how is information stored in it.One of the many frameworks, the most persistent one which is still found in our Intro to Psychology texbooks was proposed by Boradbent and later expanded on. The persisting models divided memory into Lont term memory and Short term memory and stimuli could be entered into sensory space before being filtered into short term memory. This approach consideres long term memory as having limitless capacity however Craik and Tulving's theory in 1972 took the research further by proposing levels in which menmory works. They postulated that information is encoded deeply when the information has meaning to it and is retained by the person for longer. This research paper however is interested in how self functions as a portal through which data gets processed and encoded in memory. This experiment will be the online replication of Rogers et al's unique experiment which tested the effect of self-reference along with other encoding stratgegies in a free recall test. Their experiment showed that self-reference is a strongrr encoding device than semnatic task. Self-reference is

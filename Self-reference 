Why do other tasks have capitalized and smaller words?
36 words? 
blocked? 
british vs american spellings 
after how many words the recall box?
what should i call the tasks? encoding tasks? 
words were retrieved from andersons and what is new?
12 recall boxes? 
so i see that there are "related same" 
-----
no related words 
if the word has dash or space, remove the words 

sensitivity analysis: 

try to separate what is theoretical concept and what is procedural concept in matters of encoding ot retrival task



















5 seconds after q and 3 secs for word
one another recall which wats you to engage


first variabl: 3 levels of one manipulation type. it is the task
within subjects design with encoding task 
2nd variable recall during encoding yes or no. it is withing subjects 
recall is the dependent variable
3 x 2 x2 mixed factor design with 2 within and 1 blocking as experiment 

possiblly a 3 one 
blocked vs mixed 
it will be between subjects 

some subjects will get encoding tasks in blocks and mixed 
---

in first para say we will talk about sre, causes, expplnantions and all
general hypothesis of paper 
is SRE. retrieval pratice phenomenon. does task of relating to one's self helps in retrival 
---
A ROAD MAP OF what the paper is going to be about. can include it in pargrpah
 ---
maybe time?
delayed recall does it do better?

--
a prediction graph?
